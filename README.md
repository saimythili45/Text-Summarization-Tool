#Creating a text summarization tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python can be done using several libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers.
There are two primary types of text summarization techniques:
->Extractive Summarization
->Abstractive Summarization
Extractive summarization algorithms automatically generate summaries by selecting and combining key passages from the original text.
Abstractive summarization generates entirely new sentences to convey key ideas from the original text.
